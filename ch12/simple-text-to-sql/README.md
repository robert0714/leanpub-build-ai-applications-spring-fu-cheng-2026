[![build](https://github.com/JavaAIDev/simple-text-to-sql/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JavaAIDev/simple-text-to-sql/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

> See JavaAIDev [article](https://javaaidev.com/docs/rag/samples/text-to-sql) for more details.

Test data: [Netflix data](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres-sample-dbs?tab=readme-ov-file#netflix-data)

How to run:

1. Requires Java 21 to build and run.
2. Start Postgres database using Docker Compose.
3. Start the server and use [Chat Agent UI](http://localhost:8080/webjars/chat-agent-ui/index.html)
